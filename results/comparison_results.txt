GPS vs ORB-SLAM3 TRAJECTORY COMPARISON
======================================================================

GPS Trajectory:
  Number of points: 7
  Total distance: 63.92 meters
  Duration: 60.00 seconds
  Latitude range: 33.63611559° to 33.63623779°
  Longitude range: 73.06864112° to 73.06922566°

SLAM Trajectory:
  Number of keyframes: 346
  Total distance: 7.69 meters
  Duration: 67.17 seconds

Alignment Parameters:
  Scale factor: 8.313
  Rotation angle: 280°
  Initial alignment error: 36.27 meters

Accuracy Metrics:
  RMSE: 11.03 meters
  Mean error: 10.06 meters
  Max error: 15.68 meters
  Min error: 2.29 meters

Interpretation:
  The trajectories have been aligned using:
    1. Centering (remove translation offset)
    2. Scaling (match trajectory lengths)
    3. Rotation (align orientations)

  Differences between GPS and SLAM may be due to:
    - GPS accuracy limitations (~5-10m typical for smartphones)
    - SLAM drift over time (accumulates without loop closure)
    - Different sampling rates (GPS ~1Hz vs SLAM keyframes)
    - GPS multipath effects (signal bouncing off buildings)
    - SLAM scale ambiguity in monocular vision

  Both methods successfully tracked the camera/phone movement!
